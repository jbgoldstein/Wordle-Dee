# Wordle-Dee

A compact program that guesses the next word in Wordle.

Instructions:

Enter all guessed words seperated by a space.
Mark yellow letters with a question mark (?) following the letter.
Mark green letters with an exclaimation point (!) following the letter.
For a starting word, input the word 'none'.

Sample:

If you had guessed crane (c returns green, e returns yellow) and your next guess was codes (c returns green, e and s return yellow),
then the input to guess the next word would be:

c!rane? c!ode?s?
